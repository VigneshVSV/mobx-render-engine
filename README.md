# MOBX RENDER ENGINE 

A [`mobx`](https://mobx.js.org/README.html) state management based JSON driven React renderer. Register your custom components, use the state manager to fetch a JSON containing your components' props to make the renderer render your component. 

Currently works with `hololinked.webdashboard` python package which contains python to JSON logic and `react-mui-mobx-render-engine` containing components from [`React MUI`](https://mui.com/) . Look (...will be filled...) for examples.
